# Customer Segmentation
This repository contains Python code for performing customer segmentation using K-means clustering based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. By clustering customers into groups with similar purchase behaviors, businesses can target each segment more effectively.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess customer data to extract relevant features such as total spending, purchase frequency, etc.
K-means Clustering: Implement the K-means algorithm to partition customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing patterns.
Visualization: Visualize the clusters using scatter plots to understand the distribution of customers in feature space and the centroids of each cluster.
Cluster Analysis: Analyze each cluster to identify key characteristics and behaviors that differentiate customer segments.
